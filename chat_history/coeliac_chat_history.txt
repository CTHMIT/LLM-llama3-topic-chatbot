User Question: What is the Coeliac disease?
The Answer: Coeliac disease, also known as celiac disease, is a long-term autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the small intestine. It's characterized by an intolerance to gluten, a protein found in foods like wheat, rye, and barley. The condition can cause a range of symptoms, from classic gastrointestinal problems like chronic diarrhea and abdominal distension, to non-classic symptoms that may affect any part of the body.

Would you like me to elaborate on the symptoms or discuss the diagnosis process?
